# Movie-Ticket-Booking-project-using-JSP-and-Servlet ðŸŽ¬
Project using Java, JSP, and servlets to book movie tickets online. The process of purchasing tickets from online retailers is known as an online movie ticket booking system. An online movie booking system is a website that allows you to reserve tickets in advance, find out when your movie is showing, view movie trailers, and read reviews for the films you're interested in. Sitting on your couch, you may learn everything there is to know about a movie, including the showtime, prices, and showtime.
